### What I do for you
when it's rain, I potentially go to work late. I need to register for late working to avoid a penalty. This bot help me to do that

### Usage
Run the above script every 06:45 AM every weekday.
The script is a simple scenario. You should implement more logic to make sure it's actually rain (run weather check multiple times before notify to Slack). Also need to check the late-working quota (since I have only 5 times for late working per month)
